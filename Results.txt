Article 1

1:
"Very few were tempted to tell the outside world what was happening, except when they needed extra help," he said, singling out the once-powerful Secretariat of State as one department that had especially jealously guarded its independence.

"It is important to point out that the Vatican is not broke ... the Holy See is paying its way, while possessing substantial assets and investments," Pell said, according to an advance text made available on Thursday.

The Vatican's economy minister has said hundreds of millions of euros were found "tucked away" in accounts of various Holy See departments without having appeared in the city-state's balance sheets.

In an article for Britain's Catholic Herald Magazine to be published on Friday, Australian Cardinal George Pell wrote that the discovery meant overall Vatican finances were in better shape than previously believed.

In his article, Pell said the reforms were "well under way and already past the point where the Vatican could return to the 'bad old days'."


2:
The Vatican's economy minister has said hundreds of millions of euros were found "tucked away" in accounts of various Holy See departments without having appeared in the city-state's balance sheets.

Pell's office sent a letter to all Vatican departments last month about changes in economic ethics and accountability.

1, each department will have to enact "sound and efficient financial management policies" and prepare financial information and reports that meet international accounting standards.


3:

"It was impossible for anyone to know accurately what was going on overall," said Pell, head of the new Secretariat for the Economy that is independent of the now downgraded Secretariat of State.

Pell is an outsider from the English-speaking world transferred by Pope Francis from Sydney to Rome to oversee the Vatican's often muddled finances after decades of control by Italians.

Article 2:




1.
This is an industry worth billions of dollars that could install the most advanced sewage treatment and air pollution reduction technology available, said Marcie Keever, the oceans and vessels program director at FOE. Were encouraged that some cruise lines are taking incremental steps to improve their performance, but the entire industry must stop hiding behind weak regulations and take action to make sure the oceans their ships travel remain as clear as the photos in cruise brochures.

This also inspired FOE to add a fourth transparency metric to the report card, for which all 16 cruise lines received an F.

Outside of the transparency issue, Disney Cruise Lines is apparently the most environmentally friendly, scoring an A for sewage treatment, a B- for air pollution reduction, and an A for water quality compliance.

Up through 2013, the report card had graded the cruise lines on three metrics: the quality of their sewage treatment technology, how much they reduce their air pollution through the use of cleaner fuels and plugging into onshore power, and how well they comply with water quality standards especially those established by the State of Alaska to protect its coasts.

But according to the press release from environmental group Friends of the Earth (FOE), over 40 percent of the 167 ships in operation still operate using waste treatment technology that?s more than 35 years old.


2.
FOE also cites data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which shows "an average cruise ship with 3,000 passengers and crew produces about 21,000 gallons of sewage a day enough to fill 10 backyard swimming pools in a week.

But for the 2014 report, all 16 cruise lines apparently refused to respond to FOE's request for information on their pollution reduction efforts forcing the group to rely on federal data.

Outside of the transparency issue, Disney Cruise Lines is apparently the most environmentally friendly, scoring an A for sewage treatment, a B- for air pollution reduction, and an A for water quality compliance.

Cruise ships released over one billion gallons of sewage into the ocean in 2014, according to a new report from Friends of the Earth.

The analysis, which worked off of federal data, did show that some of the 16 cruise lines assessed are slowly becoming more environmentally friendly.

Article 3:

1.
It came days after a court heard how a British man was jailed for conspiring to attend a terror training camp in Syria after he returned home after whining to his girlfriend about his treatment abroad.

Radicalised foreigners have been drawn to IS, which has conducted a series of mass executions and other atrocities since launching its offensive in Iraq and Syria in June, the report said.

The report also mentioned the Indian national, Majeed, who went to syria to fight for the militant group and was later arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for terror-related offences when he arrived back home.

Majeed told NIA officers he was sidelined by the jihadis for whom he fetched water and performed other lowly tasks such as cleaning toilets, instead of taking part in the deadly offensive like he wanted.

Photos from the brother's phones showed the strict daily schedule at the camp included two sessions of military training, two sessions of "Islamic lessons" and "lights out" at 10 p.m., the report said.

2.
Jihadis, who travelled to Iraq and Syria to join the Islamic State (IS) are begging to be allowed to return home, complaining they were forced to do menial tasks, media reported Tuesday.

Foreign recruits have been writing to their parents with feeble excuses that range from having to clean toilets and to their iPod was no longer working or that it was getting too cold, the media reported.

A series of weepy messages leaked to the French daily Le Figaro revealed a number of young French Muslim converts are having second thoughts about signing up to IS.

"I'm fed up to the back teeth. My iPod no longer works out here. I have got to come home," one of the foreign IS recruits was quoted as saying.

3.
Jihadis, who travelled to Iraq and Syria to join the Islamic State are begging to be allowed to return home, complaining they were forced to do menial tasks, media reported Tuesday.

Dozens of other recruits, who are reportedly now working with French lawyers, have collected texts and messages that suggest the jihadis felt cheated into joining IS.

One lawyer said that the longer they remain in Iraq and Syria, the more chance they have of becoming time bombs when they return.

The report also mentioned the Indian national, Majeed, who went to syria to fight for the militant group and was later arrested by the National Investigation Agency for terror-related offences when he arrived back home.

The brothers brought back bullets and took the pictures on their mobile phones to remember their time in the jihadi camp.

Al Qaeda announced in September a new chapter of its extremist movement charged with waging jihad in South Asia.

Tanvir Sheikh, father of one of Majeed's friends who was still missing in Iraq, said he felt betrayed by his son.





Article 4:

The Council, composed of the heads of state and government of all the EU member countries, must find a common negotiating position to deal with the European Parliament, which voted against a European Commission plan for regulations that would allow a two-tier internet in April.

This is not the net neutrality we want, but a move towards the creation of a two-tier network where content becomes preferred based on who pays for it to make it so," said Markus Beckedahl, Berlin-based founder of netzpolitik.

"If Merkel goes into negotiations with the position she's outlined today, it will be very difficult for the European Council to find a common position," she said.

Social Democratic Party (SPD) MEP Petra Kammerevert told The Local that this would make it more difficult to find a common European position on net neutrality.

Merkel said that some key services for the digital economy would require reliable transmission quality and should therefore be treated differently than other data.

Merkel said that some key services for the digital economy would require reliable transmission quality and should therefore be treated differently than other data.

At the Vodafone-hosted Digitising Europe conference in Berlin, she called for a splitting of services, "one for free internet, and the other for special services", adding that it was up to Brussels to negotiate how it would work.

Merkel added that these special services would run over existing internet infrastructure.

Comparisons: The following will compare how many sentences were used by both our summarizer and each of the other ones, and make special mentioni of any sentences summarized by ours that were not summarized by any of the otehr ones.

Note: it's necessary to add how many sentences could have been smilar since the online summarizers sometimes use less than five sentences.

Article 1:
summarizer 2: 1 out of 3 sentences were similar
summarizer 3: 1 out of 4 sentences were similar
summarizer 4: 0 out of 5 sentences were similar

Although 4 of the 5 sentences our summarizer came up with were different, they still centered around the article's main topic.

Article 2:
summarizer 2: 2 out of 4 sentences were similar
summarizer 3: 2 out of 5 sentences were similar
summarizer 4: 1 out of 5 sentences were similar

Again, the three sentences that weren't similar still provide important knowledge to the summary.

Article 3:
summarizer 2: 0 out of 4 sentences were similar
summarizer 3: 0 out of 5 sentences were similar
summarizer 4: 2 out of 5 sentences were similar

In this article, none of the summarizers had very many similar sentences to eachother, but all summarized it well.

Article 4:
summarizer 2: 3 out of 5 sentences were similar
summarizer 3: 3 out of 5 sentences were similar
summarizer 4: 2 out of 5 sentences were similar

The two sentences not similar were still good pieces of information.

Article 5:
summarizer 2: 2 out of 5 sentences were similar
summarizer 3: 3 out of 5 sentences were similar
summarizer 4: 0 out of 5 sentences were similar

For whatever reason, in this article The last online summarizer did a poor job of summarizing, so it's probably good it didn't share any similar sentences with ours.

Article 6:
summarizer 2: 3 out of 4 sentences were similar
summarizer 3: 3 out of 4 sentences were similar
summarizer 4: 4 out of 5 sentences were similar

In this article only 1 sentences was not also summarized by the otehr ones.
